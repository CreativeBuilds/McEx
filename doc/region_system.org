* Regions
** Size
*** Customizable?
Possibly 2x2 or 4*4 chunks
Almost certainly multiple of 2, easier math
*** Overlap?
Probably not needed
Only culprit is players rapidly leaving/joining region. Probably fine.
** Events
Entities send events to the regions they are in
** Entry
*** Joining
On joining a region, entity sends join event to region
**** Catching up with state
Region state server? Probably not
Other entities respond to join message
This needs a process that does locking, prevent race conditions
*** Leaving
On leaving, entity sends leave event
